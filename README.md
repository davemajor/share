share
=====

An app for gathering responses to a question posed through a web interface. 

This was my first attempt at making more than a one page web application using Bottle.
I also learned about Bootstrap in the process which made it look much better than I thought it could.


Initial Version:

To use this, you need to put the whole /share directory somewhere on your computer. In /share.py, change HOST to either localhost or your own IP address. Run the program using IDLE or Python 3.2 and Bottle will start listening at port 8080.

This directory will fill up with the record files for the conversations. There is a better wayI am sure, but I am still figuring out how to do this.
